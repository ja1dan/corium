# Corium
A WIP theme engine for macOS 13.

Currently supports changing icons of single apps (`./corium theme <APP_PATH> <IMG_PATH>`), and restoring their original icons (`./corium reset <APP_PATH>`).

## Credits
Huge credits go to [Serena](https://github.com/SerenaKit) for making her [Santander Wrappers](https://github.com/SerenaKit/SantanderWrappers) and helping me overall with a lot of things I didn't understand.
